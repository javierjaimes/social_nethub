# Social Nethub API CONSUMER

This was a tiny app developed to demostrate how an API RESTFULL is consumed by a ruby app. 

It was requested by the NetHub founders (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nethub-media)

This is was developed as part of my job as a Ruby Developer Consultant for Nethub.
